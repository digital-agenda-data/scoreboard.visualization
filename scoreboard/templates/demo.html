<h1>1. Analyse one indicator and compare countries</h1>

<p>This bar-chart allows you to select one indicator, one year, and see
which countries are leading the league. You can also check if the
ranking of countries has changed over the last few years. Countries are
always ordered according to their score. You can also select or
de-select countries in order to visualise only those you are interested
in.</p>
